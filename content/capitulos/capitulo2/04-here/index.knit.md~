If you use RStudio Projects consistently, you can be sure that your working directory is always the root of the project unless you actively change it.
Almost.
There are two situations in which this assumption can be broken and that can lead to errors or, even worse, surprising results.

## Root directory during knit

One issue is that when RMarkdown files are knitted, the working directory in which the code is executed is the location of the .Rmd file, which is not always the root of the project.

To show you this, we prepared a demo project.

<div class = activity> 

Get the demo project

1.  Download the [demo project](/reproducibility-with-r/demo_project.zip) and extract it anywhere in your computer.
1.  Open the project (double click on `demo_project.Rproj`), open `report-not_here.Rmd` and try to knit it.
</div>
